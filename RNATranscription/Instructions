Instructions
Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

Thes found in DNA e four nucleotidare adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and tanine (G) and urs found in RNA ahymine (T).

The four nucleotidere adenine (A), cytosine (C), guacil (U).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:

G -> C
C -> G
T -> A
A -> U
