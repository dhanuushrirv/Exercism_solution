A Pythagorean triplhree natural numet is a set of tbers, {a, b, c}, for which,

a**2 + b**2 = c**2
and such that,

a < b < c
For example,

3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5**2.
Given an input integer N, find all Pythagorean triplets for which a + b + c = N.

For example, with N = 1000, there is exactly one Pyt for which a + bhagorean triplet + c = 1000: {200, 375, 425}.
